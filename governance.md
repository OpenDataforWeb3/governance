# Adoption of document for the OpenData Community
 This a draft until voted on and adopted by the ODC Jedi

# DRAFT Governance

# Mission and Values

## Mission 
Our mission is to protect web3, focusing on:

- Sybil resistance through data science and the development of useful algorithms and other approaches
- Resisting recentralization and potential capture at the data layer

If we collectively do not resist Sybil attacks then one of the real bright spots of web3 - the collective funding of public goods - could be captured by essentially criminal forces. Similarly, if we continue to all take shortcuts when accessing and analyzing blockchain data then we are adding vulnerability to the ecosystem right above the decentralized blockchains in the form of centralization.

## Values
We want to highlight values such as:

- openness - working in public and actively requesting input
- candor - being direct and facts based
- inclusive - making a particular effort to welcome and invite a breadth of perspectives
- initiative - we are action oriented and respect and appreciate those that take on responsibility

# Governance Processes

## Discussions
Transparancy is critical to an open source community. Most ODC discussions take place on the ODC Discord. Certain ODC focused discussions may take place in-person or on other forums and when this happens it is the responibility of the people involved to drop summaries into ODC Discord, wiki, PRs, or issues to share with the community. This is to ensure the community has all the information it needs to make an informed decisions, and to provide transparency into what was decided, what was done, and why. Information related to Human Resources or some Business Development negotiations will need to kept private for legal or competative reasons. 

## Proposals
Proposals can vary broadly in their stated goals and requests. At this time proposals can be made to the ODC community or to the ODC Jedi through the Governance Repository Proposal form. Each new proposal will get it's own Discord thread under the Proposals channel. 

- They may ask the community to endorse a specific policy and procedure (e.g. “Should ODC allow VC backed projects?”), or ask the community to build something (e.g. “Building a new software tool” or “Writing improved documentation”).
- They may have no funding requests attached (e.g. “Should we adopt a new Foundation for the DAO”), or make an explicit request for funding (e.g. “We would like to create a working group focused on building a decentralized architecture for Gitcoin Grants”).

After a period of time the participants in the Discord thread can ask for a vote to be taken on the proposal.  

## Elections and Voting
At this time, only Working Groups and Projects elect leads by using the ODC voting tooling. However, the various ODC groups within the community can use the ODC voting tooling at any time. 

In the near future, ODC decisions and voting will be done on-chain. The ODC Jedi are not ready to operationally support this approach yet. 

Find more information about community-organized [Voting here](TBD).

## Funding
At this time funding projects and work activities is decided by the ODC Jedi. 

# Committee

## OpenData Community Jedi
Original founding members of the OpenData Community (ODC). As ODC grows, the ODC Jedi will be replaced with a governing board of sponsors, partners, and elected members. 

Requirements:
- Be an ODC member in good standing
- Elected by the Working Group team members

Benefits:
- All governance, business development, finance, and engineering decisions initially fall to it's members

# Groups

## ODC Projects
Achieving this stage proves that the team practices the basics of agile software development. ODC Projects are the projects under the governance of the ODC. ODC projects are listed in the [ODC Projects page] and their repositories can be found within the [ODC Github Organization]. It is not mandatory for a Sandbox team to become an official ODC project. The [ODC Projects] are groups that are directly responsible for the production of ODC software releases.

Requirements:
- Team elects a project lead and maintainers group
- Project must use the ODC tooling
- Project contributors must be ODC members
- Project Lead provides regular updates to ODC Jedi and community

Benefits:
- Project gains access to ODC business development mentoring
- Project is published in the project section of the ODC website
- Project repository is moved into the OpenDataforWeb3 GitHub organization

## Sandbox Teams

Sandbox teams are generally early stage software development projects that ODC provides repository, tooling, mentoring, and infrastuture. Any individual or team that wants to self organize can form a Sandbox team. 

Requirements:
- Be an ODC member in good standing
- Have a great idea for a project

Benefits:
- ODC Sandbox repository to hold your code and documentation
- ODC Discord channel for communications
- Mentoring on agile software development practices, Github project management tools, and how to use Git with Github repositories

## Working Groups
The [Working Groups] are not directly responsible for the production of a specific piece of ODC software. Working Groups activities center around a topic or practice that spans all the community (developers, operators, end users…), by forming a guild of people with a shared interest. Some of the working groups will phase out as is work completed, e.g. Sandbox. 

The current working groups are:
- Outreach
- Hackathon
- Business Development
- Website - Engineering
- Governance
- Sandbox
